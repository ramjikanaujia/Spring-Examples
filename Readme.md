# Key Frameworks, Libraries and Runtimes

* Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data are the backbone of the showcase.
* Hibernate as a persistence. I have plans to integrate NoSQL storages as well.
* Guava as a swiss army knife, if you like functional programming, you are impatiently waiting for closures in Java, you will love this library.
* JodaTime where SDK sucks.
* SLF4J + Logback where SDK sucks.
* JBehave for doing BDD not test scripts.
* TestNG for testing on steroids, no more JUnit. 
* Mockito the best library for mocking, developed by Polish guy!
* FestAssert to address a little bit not so flexible Java syntax.
* TwitterBootstrap give a good support for developer with strong server side background (me).
* AngularJS as JS MVC platform.
* ActiveMQ for asynchronous processing, integration with WebSockets is comming ...
* CloudBees as a awesome runtime platform and continuous delivery automation tool (Jenkins).
* MySql as a default database, but in memory H2 for integration tests. 
* Hexagonal architecture
* And last but not least: old good Maven. I will migrate project to Gradle eventually ...
